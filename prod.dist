# This is a configuration file for the reseed service
#

# Please add import-netdb.sh to crontab after configuring this file
# Example:
# $Â (crontab -l ; echo @daily /path/to/import-netdb.sh) | crontab 

# Howto create a reseed keypair:
#
# OpenSSL (For the webserver) example:
# openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key.pem -out server.cert.pem -days 3650
#
# SU3 File signing example:
# java -cp /opt/i2p/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.SU3File keygen -t6 public.reseed.key keystoreReseed.ks meeh@mail.i2p
#

# Make sure this always is 0 in production environments!
DEBUG=0

#
# NETDB is per default set by import-netdb.sh to read from a unix user named i2p's home (example; /home/i2p/.i2p/netDb)
# You can override it here if your configuration is different, or you're running i2p as a different user
#
# NETDB = /path/to/i2p/.netDb

# Make those variables match your environment
